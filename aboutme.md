# About the Alaska Coronavirus Variant Dashboard
This dashboard was created as part of the *Alaska SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Consortium* which is an partnership between the University of Alaska, Alaska State Virology Lab, Department of Health and Social Services, and other state agencies with the aim to increase genomic surveillance of variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) in the state of Alaska.  Coronavirus variants have the potential to spread more rapidly, cause more severe disease, evade diagnostic detection, or reduce vaccine efficacy.  Timely and accurate surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants is key to informing public health policy and thus efforts to control the pandemic.

On this dashboard you can find updates on a weekly basis on variants circulating in the state of Alaska.  Data found here can be found on GISAID.
